# YouTube-Social-Network-Analysis

* This project uses machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Classification, to analyze a graph of connected nodes on YouTube. The graph represents the relationships between different channels and users, and the aim is to predict the number of connections for YouTube channels based on the graph's connectivity information. The project also explores different feature engineering techniques and parameter tuning to optimize the model's performance. 
* The results can be beneficial for content creators, marketers, and YouTube analytics professionals in identifying potential opportunities for collaborations and marketing strategies. The dataset used is downloaded from Stanford's snap.stanford.edu, and the graph database management system Neo4j is used to work with the data. The project also implements Hadoop for clustering and distributed computing, and the distributed clustering package for Neo4j for online analytical processing.
